Will need to do something like this to the test database supplied by the AAVSO.

The supplied database has 4,820,120 observations.

Just adding a column takes over three minutes on an 8 GB 2.2 GHz Core i7
Early 2015 MacBook Air with 512GB SSD storage. Dropping the column also takes
over three minutes. I suspect the times are limited by the drive's write speed.

mysql> ALTER TABLE temp_observations DROP COLUMN timeseries;

mysql> USE test;
Database changed

mysql> ALTER TABLE temp_observations DROP COLUMN timeseries;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (3 min 19.02 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> ALTER TABLE temp_observations ADD COLUMN timeseries INT(13);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (3 min 25.80 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql>
